Backend Development with Node.js: Explaining server-side development using Node.js, including setting up a basic server and handling HTTP requests.

<Callout>
  In this article, we will explore the fundamentals of backend development using
  Node.js. We'll cover topics such as setting up a basic server, handling HTTP
  requests, and understanding the core concepts of server-side development.
  Let's dive in!

Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime that allows developers to build scalable and high-performance server-side applications. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of creating a basic server and handling HTTP requests using Node.js.

### Setting Up a Basic Server

To get started, you'll need to install Node.js on your system if you haven't already. Once installed, create a new file, for example, `server.js`, and add the following code to set up a basic server:

```javascript
const http = require("http");

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/plain");
  res.end("Hello, World!\n");
});

const PORT = 3000;
server.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${PORT}/`);
});
```

In this code, we import the `http` module, create a server instance, and set it to listen on port 3000. When you run this script, your Node.js server will respond with "Hello, World!" to any incoming requests.

### Handling HTTP Requests

Node.js provides a simple and effective way to handle different types of HTTP requests, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. You can use various libraries like Express.js to streamline the process, but let's understand the basic concept with Node.js's built-in `http` module.

Here's an example of handling a GET request and sending a JSON response:

```javascript
const http = require("http");

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  if (req.method === "GET" && req.url === "/api/data") {
    const data = {
      message: "This is a sample JSON response from the server.",
    };
    res.statusCode = 200;
    res.setHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
    res.end(JSON.stringify(data));
  } else {
    res.statusCode = 404;
    res.end("Not Found");
  }
});

const PORT = 3000;
server.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${PORT}/`);
});
```

In this example, the server responds with a JSON object when a GET request is made to the `/api/data` endpoint. For other routes, it returns a 404 status code with "Not Found."

This is just the beginning of what you can achieve with Node.js for backend development. As you delve deeper, you can explore database integration, authentication, and building RESTful APIs.

Remember, this is a basic overview, and there's much more to learn and explore in the world of Node.js backend development. Stay curious and keep coding!
